      <p>In the quaint village of Wintervale, nestled between towering snow-capped mountains, lived a young girl named Seraphina Snowbrook. Orphaned at a tender age, she resided with her uncle, who worked tirelessly at the local bookstore, "Wise Words and Wonders." Though life was ordinary, Seraphina felt an unexplainable void, as if she were waiting for something extraordinary to happen.</p>
      <p>One chilly morning, a mysterious letter arrived at the Snowbrook doorstep, addressed to Seraphina. It bore the official crest of the "Aurora Academy of Magic."
